# BSV SDK

BSV BLOCKCHAIN | Standard Development Kit for JavaScript and TypeScript

Welcome to the BSV Blockchain Libraries Project, the comprehensive TypeScript SDK designed to provide an updated and unified layer for developing scalable applications on the BSV Blockchain. This SDK addresses the limitations of previous tools by offering a fresh, peer-to-peer approach, adhering to SPV, and ensuring privacy and scalability.

## Objective

The BSV Blockchain Libraries Project aims to structure and maintain a middleware layer of the BSV Blockchain technology stack. By facilitating the development and maintenance of core libraries, it serves as an essential toolkit for developers looking to build on the BSV Blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install the SDK, run:

```bash
npm install @bsv/sdk
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of using the SDK to create and sign a transaction:

```typescript
// TODO: Code Example Will Go Here
```

For a more detailed tutorial and advanced examples, check our [Documentation](#documentation).

## Features & Deliverables

- **Sound Cryptographic Primitives**: Secure key management, signature computations, and encryption protocols.
  
- **Script Level Constructs**: Network-compliant script interpreter with support for custom scripts and serialization formats.
  
- **Transaction Construction and Signing**: Comprehensive transaction builder API, ensuring versatile and secure transaction creation.
  
- **Transaction Broadcast Management**: Mechanisms to send transactions to both miners and overlays, ensuring extensibility and future-proofing.
  
- **Merkle Proof Verification**: Tools for representing and verifying merkle proofs, adhering to various serialization standards.
  
- **Serializable SPV Structures**: Structures and interfaces for full SPV verification.
  
- **Secure Encryption and Signed Messages**: Enhanced mechanisms for encryption and digital signatures, replacing outdated methods.

## Documentation

The SDK is richly documented with code-level annotations. This should show up well within editors like VSCode. For complete API docs, check out [API.md](./API.md). Please refer to the [Libraries Wiki](#) (link to be provided) for a deep dive into each feature, tutorials, and usage examples.
